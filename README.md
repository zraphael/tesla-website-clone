A Tesla website clone made with React, coded along with a coding video from Clever Programmer, I really enjoy working with this type of videos to get familiar with how some things work, so that I can reuse them in other projects. This one uses Redux

There's still a problem with the menu that I need to fix.

## Start instruction

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
